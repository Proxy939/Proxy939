- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Myself**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **I am a multi-stack developer on a mission to build the next generation of intelligent software. My work sits at the intersection of Full Stack Web, Android Development, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I specialize in creating cohesive digital ecosystems where Machine Learning models power the core, and AI Agents/Bots handle the automation. Whether it’s a mobile app or a web platform, I strive to make software that doesn't just work it thinks**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Open-source projects that bridge the gap between AI and Automation—specifically building automated data pipelines, fine-tuning LLMs, or developing intelligent Python bots and predictive models that make software smarter and more efficient.**

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with **Mastering Deep Learning architectures (CNNs/RNNs), understanding the mathematics behind gradient descent, and optimizing hyperparameters for better model accuracy.**

- 💬 Ask me about **When i am fixing the code even my ai agent tells me to move on and accept it**

- 📄 Know about my experiences (Computer Engineering student | AI & Full-Stack Projects | Learning by building 🚀)

- ⚡ Fun fact **Hard work is my talent and talent without hardwork is nothing**
